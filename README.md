You need to install asyncio, python-osc and shelve using pip.

You need to add a Contact Receiver on the head and nose, the paramaters be called what ever but to make it easier
call the nose booper Paramater: "NoseBoop" 
And for the headpat Paramater: "HeadPat" 

Once you have done that run the python script and in game when you trigger the nose booper/headpat you should see the value go up 
by one at a time, it has a delay so it can try to combat spam and not get the message box timed out.

The python script will make some files that start with B_and_H, be sure to keep them as they are what store your count value and if you delete
them you will restart to 0 boops and headpats.

If you need any more help message me @ Bently#5823
